<h2><font color="#7F0000">Description of the workshop</font></h2>

We will hold an online (Zoom) GeoClaw Users' Workshop on March
19-20, 2026, with a series of short talks (~15 minutes) by developers
and users about interesting GeoClaw-related projects, interspersed
with time for discussion and break-out groups to enable chatting
more with the speakers or other participants.  One-on-one time with
developers will also be available for users who need assistance
with using GeoClaw.

<p>
The workshop will run from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm Pacific Daylight
Time on both Thursday and Friday.  Participants are welcome to come
and go as desired, and participation in break-out groups is entirely
optional. If there is sufficient interest, some additional break-out
groups may be organized later each day, particularly for users who
might want to work with each other or with GeoClaw developers to
make progress on a GeoClaw-related project.

<p>
<h3>Registration Form</h3>
