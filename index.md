# GeoClaw Users' Workshop



We will hold an online (Zoom) GeoClaw Users' Workshop on March
19-20, 2026, with a series of short talks (~15 minutes) by developers
and users about interesting
[GeoClaw](https://www.geoclaw.org)-related projects
(including also related packages such as
[D-Claw](https://www.clawpack.org/dclaw.html),
[ForestClaw](http://www.forestclaw.org/ForestClaw/index.html),
[BingClaw](https://github.com/norwegian-geotechnical-institute/BingCLAW_5.6.1), etc.)
interspersed, with time for discussion and break-out groups to enable chatting
more with the speakers or other participants.  One-on-one time with
developers will also be available for users who need assistance
with using GeoClaw.

The workshop will run from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm Pacific Daylight
Time on both Thursday and Friday.  Participants are welcome to come
and go as desired, and participation in break-out groups is entirely
optional. If there is sufficient interest, some additional break-out
groups may be organized later each day, particularly for users who
might want to work with each other or with GeoClaw developers to
make progress on a GeoClaw-related project.

The [Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRQ4bAKg6rdKv8ufglGM1k8b9BA9pNUkf2M3MidK6fBPk2hQ/viewform?usp=sharing&ouid=104699547737300222961) also allows you to give us some
information on your interests and projects, if you so desire, and to let us
know if you are interested in giving a talk.

contains these webpages and can also be used for sharing resources.

Participants agree to abide by the
